    I recently discovered your website by watching a story on CNN about education in America. When I logged in, I was thrilled to find all of these videos!!
        
        I'm 35 and attended different public high schools in Chicago. It was the most horrible environment for learning and traumatic for me. I haven't had the confidence to set foot inside of a college classroom. I'm at about a 6th or 7th grade level in math. My writing is decent through and that is a result of a natural love of reading. Somehow through my grasp of common sense, I've been promoted in various companies in a management role. But I never felt academically adequate when comparing my education to my peers.
        
        So imagine my delight and shock to find out there was your website that I can start using for free at my own pace! I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone involved in creating this. I'm so grateful. I signed up both of my sons and I just know they are going to benefit from this. Thank you so much!
