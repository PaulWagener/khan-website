	<h1>Different types of learners</h1>
	<hr>
	<p class="lead">Ways KA can be used to engage different types of students.</p>
	
	<h5>Motivated learners</h5>
	<p>These students often use KA at home and progress through KA at impressive speeds!  If your motivated learners have already gone through all the material that you’ve prepared for them, here are some suggestions:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Allow your students to continue to move at their own pace by having them watch videos and practice exercises of their choosing</li>
		<li>Give your students a project that will deepen their conceptual learning of the exercises they have just mastered</li>
		<li>Sharpen your students’ social skills by having them peer tutor other students</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>Disengaged learners</h5>
	<p>These students may be uninterested in KA and use time on the computer to goof off or procrastinate.</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Diagnose the problem: Does the student have all prerequisite skills necessary for the exercise being worked on? If not, consider giving the student time to complete the prerequisites first. Is there a situation outside of school that is affecting the student’s concentration?  What is the student’s history in math?  In school?</li>
		<li>Find incentives and motivators: set appropriate goals and celebrate small successes, share data with other “coaches” or family members/influencers, encourage and reward improvement in attitude/work ethic</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>Dependent learners</h5>
	<p>These students may work diligently, but they tend to ask for help frequently, be insecure in their own answers, and need lots of guidance.</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Emphasize a series of learning habits such as taking hints and watching a video before directly asking the teacher a question (see a handout on this here)</li>
		<li>If students ask you to check their answers before they submit their final answer, encourage them to double check their work and submit their final answer when they feel ready. The more time you have to spend checking student work, the less time there is to actually teach new concepts to students who need it most.</li>
