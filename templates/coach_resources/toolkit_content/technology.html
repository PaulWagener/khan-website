	<p class="lead">Khan Academy is ready to go with a sturdy internet connection and a modern web browser.</p>
	
	<p>Since beginning our work with schools in late 2010, we've seen a variety of different technology approaches to integrating Khan Academy. The most important categories to ensure your school has locked down are log-in/accounts, computers and devices, and internet connectivity.</p>
	
	<h5>Log-in / accounts</h5>
	<p>For a large number of accounts, we currently recommend Google Apps for Education (described in the <a href="/toolkit/setting-up-accounts">accounts section</a>). Google Apps for Education is the only way to register under-13 users on Khan Academy (with appropriate parental consent).</p>
	<p>Today, for all users, we support Google and Facebook authentication, and do not have our own authentication service.</p>
	
	<h5>Computers and devices</h5>
	<p>Khan Academy runs entirely in your browser and there is no special software required to use Khan Academy. As such, any device that can run a modern internet browser can be used to access Khan Academy. In the schools we work with we have seen the whole gamut including Laptops, Chromebooks, Netbooks, iPads and other tablet devices.</p>
	<p>We recommend having a 1:1 student-to-computer ratio in the classroom at the time of use. Many schools often share laptop carts between classrooms. Also of note: we have seen some schools employ an open access policy where they let students bring in their own devices.</p>
	
	<h5>Internet connectivity</h5>
	<p>Classrooms should understand access point availability and bandwidth:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li><strong>Access points</strong>
		A classroom full of simultaneous Khan Academy users should be capable of supporting that many simultaneous connections. So, in a class of 30 students who will be engaging with a Khan Academy session, the wireless would need to accomodate 30 simultaneous connections</li>
		<li><strong>Connection speed (bandwidth)</strong>
		Khan Academy requires a broadband connection (~1.5 Mbps for a single machine viewing standard definition video) to watch videos, practice using exercises, and view teacher / student dashbaord data</li>
	</ul>
