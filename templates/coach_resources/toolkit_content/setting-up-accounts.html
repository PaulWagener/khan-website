	<h1>Setting up accounts</h1>
	<hr>
	<p class="lead">In order to get the most out of Khan Academy, you'll need to set up student and teacher accounts. We've created a handy guide to make sure you'll be up and running in no time.</p>
	<p>We recommend setting up Google accounts to register classes on Khan Academy. You can register accounts through Google Apps for Education.</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/edu/k12.html">Google Apps for Education registration</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=139019">Google Apps for Education common questions</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>A smooth start to class</h5>
	<p>To ensure that class is able to begin on the right track, we recommend pre-registering students for class with assigned Google accounts (e.g., john-appleseed@school.org for the student John Appleseed) and passwords (e.g., school2012).</p>
		
	<p>For those of you who have been there before, the first time logging in to any new system can be a bit... hectic. We've included a sample hand out to guide students through the set up + coach linking process (see more detail below) <strong>TODO: add in sample document</strong></p>	
	
	<p>In order to link student accounts to a coach account (the teacher/parent/tutor/etc account), follow the instructions below:</p>
		
	<!-- TODO(Matt): Link to coach.html template instead of copying in file contents. -->
						
    {% set coach_email = UserData.current().email if UserData.current() else "Sign in for your Coach id." %}

    <div id="empty-class">
        {% if class_is_empty %}
        <h1>You don't have any students yet.</h1>
        {% endif %}
        <h3>Each of your students needs to sign in and follow these steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, they should visit <a href="/profile">their profile</a> by clicking on their name at the top of the page.</p>
                <img src="/images/profile-link-in-header.png?1" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then, they should click on the Coaches tab.</p>
                <img src="/images/coaches-nav.png?1" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background"/>
            </li>
            <li class="enter-email">
                <!-- Are you a flying chimpanzee? Are you changing this element or anything inside?
                If you answered yes to any of these questions, please update the positioning of the coach email.
                Look in default.css for #empty-class ol li.enter-email div.coach-email -->
                <p>Finally, they need to enter your Coach id and click the <em>Add coach</em> button.</p>
                {% if UserData.current() %}
                    <p>Your Coach id is <strong>{{ coach_email|escape }}</strong>.</p>
                {% else %}
                    <p>{{ coach_email|escape}}</p>
                {% endif %}
                <div class="coach-email">{{ coach_email|escape }}</div>
                <img src="/images/coaches-tab-in-profile.png?1" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background"/>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once students make you their coach, you'll have access to all types of interesting data about their progress and achievements.</p>
        <p>You can access that data via the <a href="/class_profile">Class Report</a>.</p>
